# HondaHack 7.6.0 Rebuild Progress

Last updated: 2026-11-04

## Phase 16 — Multi-widget meter editor

- Parser now validates every views[] entry (up to 32 widgets), not just the first.
- Preview canvas draws all widgets and supports per-widget alignment, size and color.
- Editor supports selecting, adding and removing widgets, plus editing x/y position and width/height using normalized coordinates.
- Save widget layout stores widget count and widget settings locally; reset restores the bundled preset.
- Unit tests now cover multiple widgets, rendering, alignment and invalid layouts.
- This phase is implemented in source; the new CI run is pending and must pass before the updated APK is marked build-verified.

Details: MULTI_WIDGET_METER_EDITOR.md (phase notes are also recorded in this progress entry).  
Repository: https://github.com/qiangge5586-a11y/1  
Target: independent Android rebuild based on the user's supplied HondaHack 7.6.0 APK and reverse-analysis notes.

## Current verified status

- Original APK identity and SHA-256 recorded; see `APK_BASELINE_INVENTORY.md`.
- Original binary manifest, DEX class/method structures and resource inventory audited; see `MANIFEST_COMPONENT_AUDIT.md`, `DEX_CLASS_METHOD_MAP.md`, `RESOURCE_FEATURE_ASSET_AUDIT.md`.
- DEX instruction-reference triage completed for meter, navigation, steering-key, startup, audio, voice, GPS and receiver paths; see `DEX_BYTECODE_BEHAVIOR_AUDIT.md`. This is not full Java decompilation or runtime proof.
- Independent Android app skeleton builds successfully.
- Offline meter parser, editor canvas, editable speed/text size/position/colors and reset control implemented.
- Steering-key mapping simulator with four configurable mock keys and persistent action selections implemented.
- Navigation-app detection and explicit launch buttons implemented for package IDs found in the original APK.
- Unit tests for meter preset parsing and validation are included in CI.

## Latest build verification

GitHub Actions run #31:
- Run ID: `41755385647`
- Commit: `64ffbe9b039b044051c1059b379e9a7b5333a0ba`
- Run URL: https://github.com/qiangge5586-a11y/1/actions/runs/41755385647
- The `Assemble debug APK` step completed successfully. That command runs `:app:testDebugUnitTest` followed by `:app:assembleDebug`.
- The `Upload debug APK` step completed successfully.
- Artifact ID: `13287766903`; artifact name: `hondahack-rebuild-debug`.
- Downloaded APK size: 22,646 bytes (approx. 22.6 KB).
- APK SHA-256: `c26c2a8f0c70682459e43807ec868da363e98d3d90f30ef74339d43403196921`.

The workflow completed with conclusion `success`; test/build and artifact-upload steps all succeeded. This artifact is a debug prototype, not a complete or pixel-identical HondaHack clone.

## Phase history

1. Original 7.6.0 APK verified and fingerprinted.
2. APK ZIP/DEX structural inventory recorded.
3. Existing source ZIP audited: 47 entries, two Java files and basic Gradle/manifest/assets scaffolding; not a complete clone.
4. Feature traceability and safe rebuild boundaries documented.
5. Initial Android project and GitHub Actions debug build established.
6. Binary AndroidManifest.xml parsed: package/version/SDK, permissions and declared components recorded.
7. DEX class_data mapped; app entrypoint methods inventoried.
8. Meter JSON presets, audio resources and privileged payload indicators audited.
9. Preliminary DEX instruction-reference behavior map completed; JADX readable decompilation remains outstanding.
10. Offline meter preset parser/repository and validation tests added.
11. CI updated to run unit tests before assembling the debug APK.
12. Interactive meter editor added with persistent speed, text size and theme settings.
13. Normalized-coordinate canvas, horizontal/vertical layout controls and reset function added.
14. Configurable steering-key simulator added; it does not capture physical inputs or issue vehicle commands.
15. Safe navigation-app detection and explicit launcher added; it does not force-stop, modify or inject into other apps.

## Safety and compatibility boundaries

- No root/Xposed installer, signature spoofing, app_process replacement, platform permission modification, silent installation, remote revocation, destructive shell commands or system-partition writes.
- No force-stop/kill of third-party apps and no undocumented vendor service calls.
- Meter and vehicle values remain mock data. No CAN/OBD/ECU telemetry integration is implemented.
- The user's 2019 Civic factory head-unit compatibility is not assumed from package strings or Mitsubishi/Clarion vendor intents. Model, firmware and documented interfaces must be identified before device integration.
- The debug APK has not yet been tested on the user's vehicle or factory head unit.

## Next steps

1. Obtain readable JADX output and review high-value original methods (MyService, MeterActivity, NavigatorActivity, RemapKeysActivity, StartupActivity and VoiceAssistantService).
2. Add named preset save/rename/duplicate/import/export.
3. Add safe, explicit audio-focus controls and startup preferences using public Android APIs.
4. Build a compatibility matrix for the exact Civic factory head-unit model/firmware.
5. Test the debug APK on a spare Android device first; do not modify the live vehicle head unit until a documented interface and rollback path are confirmed.

<!-- Previous roadmap retained below for historical context. -->

1. Obtain readable JADX output and review high-value original methods, especially `MyService`, `MeterActivity`, `NavigatorActivity`, `RemapKeysActivity`, `StartupActivity` and `VoiceAssistantService`.
2. Extend the meter editor to multiple widgets, drag positioning, font/alignment/stroke/shadow/background assets and named presets with import/export.
3. Add safe, explicit audio-focus controls and startup preferences using public Android APIs.
4. Build a device compatibility matrix for the exact Civic factory head-unit model/firmware.
5. Test the debug APK on a spare Android device first; do not modify the live vehicle head unit until a documented interface and rollback path are confirmed.
